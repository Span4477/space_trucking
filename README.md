To use this code, you'll need to download python and install the requirements using pip.

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.14.2
```

Running this code will download a bunch of data from the internet and save the files into folders.
I do not have any control over the contents or availability of the files.

If you have found this code to be helpful or useful, please consider sending ISK donations to my
